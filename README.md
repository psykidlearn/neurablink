neurablink is a lightweight, fun tool designed to remind users to blink while using their screens. By encouraging regular blinking, neurablink can help users counteract some common discomforts associated with long periods of screen time, such as eye strain and dry eyes.

Note: neurablink is not a medical product, and it makes no health claims. It is designed solely for personal use as a wellness tool and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Use neurablink at your own discretion and consult an eye care professional if you have concerns about your eye health.
